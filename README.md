# NETMIX-FRONT

An innovative web app for finding, organising, reviewing and sharing Movies and TV Shows from all of the major online streaming providers.

I single handedly built Netmix over the course of just two weeks for my Flatiron School Final Project. In order to achieve the desired functionality I built a React frontend utilising more than 30 custom components, a Rails backend with PostgreSQL Database, and integrated two seperate external APIs.
